Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced approach in natural language processing (NLP) that combines the strengths of retrieval-based models and generation-based models to enhance the quality of responses.
Retrieval Component: 
           Retrieves relevant documents or passages from a large corpus based on the input query.
Generation Component:
           Uses the retrieved information to generate a coherent and informative response.
